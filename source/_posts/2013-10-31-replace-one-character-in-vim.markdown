Just write down this litte trick for further use. The problem how to replace one character in vim does be really simple for me now.   

*  First go into the Command Mode where you can issue many vi(m) commands.
*  Move the cursor to the positon where your wanted character lies.
*  Then press Key r (in lowser case) and enter your desired character to replace the wanted one.
